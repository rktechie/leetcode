 * Problem 973: K Closest Points to Origin
 * 
We have a list of points on the plane.  Find the K closest points to the origin (0, 0).

(Here, the distance between two points on a plane is the Euclidean distance.)

You may return the answer in any order.  The answer is guaranteed to be unique (except for the order that it is in.)

Example 1:

Input: points = [[1,3],[-2,2]], K = 1
Output: [[-2,2]]
Explanation: 
The distance between (1, 3) and the origin is sqrt(10).
The distance between (-2, 2) and the origin is sqrt(8).
Since sqrt(8) < sqrt(10), (-2, 2) is closer to the origin.
We only want the closest K = 1 points from the origin, so the answer is just [[-2,2]].
Example 2:

Input: points = [[3,3],[5,-1],[-2,4]], K = 2
Output: [[3,3],[-2,4]]
(The answer [[-2,4],[3,3]] would also be accepted.)
 

Note:

1 <= K <= points.length <= 10000
-10000 < points[i][0] < 10000
-10000 < points[i][1] < 10000

Note: Go through both the solutions given below - they are very helpful in understanding pros and cons

Note: That while calculating the euclidean distance, calculate the distance of point from origin i.e. (0,0)

	 * 1st Solution: (most efficient) Based on Heap Sort 
	 * We don't have to sort all points.
	 * Instead, we can maintain a max-heap with size K. Then for each point, we add it to the heap. 
	 * Once the size of the heap is greater than K, we are supposed to extract one from the max heap to 
	 * ensure the size of the heap is always K. 
	 * Thus, the max heap is always maintain top K smallest elements from the first one to current one. 
	 * Once the size of the heap is over its maximum capacity, it will exclude the maximum element in it, 
	 * since it can not be the proper candidate anymore.
	 * 
	 * Theoretically, the time complexity is O(NlogK)
	 * 
	 * The advantage of this solution is it can deal with real-time(online) stream data. It does not have to know the size of the data previously.
	 * The disadvatage of this solution is it is not the most efficient solution.
