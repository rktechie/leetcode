/*
 * Problem 127: Word Ladder
 * 
Given two words (beginWord and endWord), and a dictionary's word list, find the length of shortest transformation sequence from beginWord to endWord, such that:

    Only one letter can be changed at a time
    Each intermediate word must exist in the word list

For example,

Given:
beginWord = "hit"
endWord = "cog"
wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]

As one shortest transformation is "hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> "cog",
return its length 5.

Note:

    Return 0 if there is no such transformation sequence.
    All words have the same length.
    All words contain only lowercase alphabetic characters.

     * This is a BFS approach. Don't be mislead by the word "depth" in the comments.
     * Time Complexity: O(M×N), where M is the length of words and N is the total number of words in the input word list. 
     * Finding out all the transformations takes M iterations for each of the N words. 
     * Also, breadth first search in the worst case might go to each of the N words.
     * 
     * Space Complexity: O(M×N), to store all M transformations for each of the N words, in the all_combo_dict dictionary. 
     * Visited dictionary is of N size. Queue for BFS in worst case would need space for all N words.
