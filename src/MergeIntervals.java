/*
 * Problem 56: Merge Intervals
 * 
Given a collection of intervals, merge all overlapping intervals.

Example 1:

Input: [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Explanation: Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlaps, merge them into [1,6].
Example 2:

Input: [[1,4],[4,5]]
Output: [[1,5]]
Explanation: Intervals [1,4] and [4,5] are considered overlapping.

	/*
	 * The idea is to sort the intervals by their starting points. 
	 * Then, we take the first interval and compare its end with the next intervals starts. 
	 * As long as they overlap, we update the end to be the max end of the overlapping intervals. 
	 * Once we find a non overlapping interval, we can add the previous "extended" interval and start over.
	 * 
	 * Sorting takes O(n log(n)) and merging the intervals takes O(n). So, the resulting algorithm takes O(n log(n)).
	 * 
	 * I used an a lambda comparator (Java 8) and a for-each loop to try to keep the code clean and simple.
