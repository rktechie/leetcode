/*
 * Problem 42 : Trapping Rain Water
 * 
Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it is able to trap after raining.


The above elevation map is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped. Thanks Marcos for contributing this image!

Example:

Input: [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
Output: 6

	 * 1. Use two pointers to scan the entire array until they meet with each other.

	 * 4. if a wall is found taller than the max height wall in the other side, stop there (because taller wall may
