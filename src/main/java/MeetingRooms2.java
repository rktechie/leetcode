/*
 * Problem 253: Meeting Rooms II
 * 
Given an array of meeting time intervals consisting of start and end times [[s1,e1],[s2,e2],...] (si < ei), find the minimum number of conference rooms required.

Example 1:

Input: [[0, 30],[5, 10],[15, 20]]
Output: 2
Example 2:

Input: [[7,10],[2,4]]
Output: 1
NOTE: input types have been changed on April 15, 2019. Please reset to default code definition to get new method signature.

	/*
	 * Solution 1
	 * Just add the meeting room to the queue, if no overlap, poll it and add the next meeting. 
	 * Whenever there's an overlap, add the next meeting to create an additional room. 
	 * Finally, just return the size of the priority queue for the total # of meeting rooms.
	 * 
	 * Time Complexity: O(NlogN).
	 * There are two major portions that take up time here. One is sorting of the array that takes O(NlogN) 
	 * considering that the array consists of N elements.
	 * 
	 * Then we have the min-heap. 
	 * In the worst case, all N meetings will collide with each other. 
	 * In any case we have N add operations on the heap. 
	 * 
	 * In the worst case we will have N extract-min operations as well. 
	 * Overall complexity being (NlogN) since extract-min operation on a heap takes O(logN).
	 * 
	 *
	 * Space Complexity: O(N) because we construct the min-heap and that can contain N elements in the worst 
	 * case as described above in the time complexity section. Hence, the space complexity is O(N).
