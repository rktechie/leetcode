/*
 * Problem 114: Flatten Binary Tree to Linked List
 * 
Given a binary tree, flatten it to a linked list in-place.

For example,
Given

         1
        / \
       2   5
      / \   \
     3   4   6

The flattened tree should look like:

   1
    \
     2
      \
       3
        \
         4
          \
           5
            \
             6

Hints:

If you notice carefully in the flattened tree, each node's right child points to the next node of a pre-order traversal.

     * We keep going down the tree till we reach the node whose children are leafs or till the left
     * of the left child of the parent is null.
     * 
     * We then make the left child as the right child of the parent.
     * And the original right child becomes the right child of the new right child.
     * 
     * While shifting the left child as the right child, If the left child is not a single node,
     * then we find the right most element of that left child, now the original right child will
     * become the right child of this rightmost child.
     * 
     * Keep this example in your mind : [1,2,null,3]
     * If we don't find the rightmost child of the left child during shifting phase then the answer we get is: [1,null,2]
     * But the actual answer is : [1,null,2,null,3]
