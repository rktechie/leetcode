/*
 * Problem 232: Implement Queue using Stacks
 * 
Implement the following operations of a queue using stacks.

    push(x) -- Push element x to the back of queue.
    pop() -- Removes the element from in front of queue.
    peek() -- Get the front element.
    empty() -- Return whether the queue is empty.

Notes:

    You must use only standard operations of a stack -- which means only push to top, peek/pop from top, size, and is empty operations are valid.
    Depending on your language, stack may not be supported natively. 
    You may simulate a stack by using a list or deque (double-ended queue), as long as you use only standard operations of a stack.
    You may assume that all operations are valid (for example, no pop or peek operations will be called on an empty queue).
