/*
 * Problem 209: Minimum Size Subarray Sum
 * 
Given an array of n positive integers and a positive integer s, find the minimal length of a subarray of which the sum â‰¥ s.
If there isn't one, return 0 instead.

For example, given the array [2,3,1,2,4,3] and s = 7,
the subarray [4,3] has the minimal length under the problem constraint.

If you have figured out the O(n) solution, try coding another solution of which the time complexity is O(n log n).

     * 
     * We will maintain a window that grows until "sum" reaches the given sum i.e. "s".
     * Once the window grows to sum at least s then we can start shirking the window from left with the hope to find a smaller window. 
     * We shrink until sum falls below s.
     * Then we can grow the window on right again and so on.
     * We keep this procedure of growing-shrinking until the window end reaches the end of the array.

     * Time complexity: O(n)
